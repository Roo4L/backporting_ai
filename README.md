# Backporting.ai

**Backporting.ai** is a community-driven platform dedicated to assembling and sharing knowledge about automated patch backporting. We collect research papers, blog posts, open-source projects, and industry updates—all in one place—to help researchers, developers, and organizations stay informed about the latest developments in this field.

## What is Patch Backporting?

Patch backporting is the process of applying bug fixes, security patches, or feature updates from newer versions of software to older, stable versions. Automating this process is crucial for maintaining long-term support (LTS) releases, especially in large-scale systems like the Linux kernel, enterprise software, and critical infrastructure.
