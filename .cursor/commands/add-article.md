# add-article

Add article to the list of articles in src/data/resources.json from the link that you has been provided with.
Open the link itself, get the article name and other relevant information and append entry to the resources list.
Before appending the article, verify whether we already have it in our
resources or not. If we do, reject the task and point user to already
existing entry.
