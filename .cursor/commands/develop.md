# develop

Develop the feature that you are going to be asked to.

Analyze the feature request, implement it, and then, test the feature afterwards.

If test is successful, commit the changes in the current branch. Commit only those changes
that you have done during feature development. DO NOT COMMIT ANY OTHER CHANGES FROM WORKDIR!

During development, maintain a to-do list with the development stages you have to do (develop, test, commit).

## Special cases handling

- When developing features that are supposed to be somehow displayed on the webpage, test their
  presence and view using Google Chrome Devtools MCP server. Take screenshots to make sure that
  everything looks as expected, instead of relying on html code alone.
