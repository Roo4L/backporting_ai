# Git Workflow

Full conventions are documented in [docs/dev/git-workflow.md](../../../docs/dev/git-workflow.md). Read that file for detailed rules and examples.

## Quick Reference

- **Commits**: imperative mood, capitalized, ~72 char subject. Add body for non-trivial changes.
- **Branches**: flat descriptive names (`add-search`, `fix-broken-link`). Branch from `main`.
- **Merge strategy**: rebase and merge (linear history).
- **PRs**: use `gh pr create`. Brief summary description. Target `main`.
- **Deploy**: merging to `main` auto-deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Maintainer Shortcut

As the sole maintainer, small changes that do **not** need CI/CD to verify can be pushed directly to `main` without a feature branch or PR. This includes:

- Documentation updates (markdown files, docs/)
- Cursor skills and rules (.cursor/)
- Minor config that does not affect the build

Everything else (UI changes, features, bug fixes, build-affecting config) **must** go through a feature branch and PR.

## Feature Workflow

Use this for any change that affects the site build or functionality.

```
1. git checkout main && git pull origin main
2. git checkout -b <branch-name>
3. Make commits (imperative mood, capitalized)
4. git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
5. git push -u origin <branch-name>
6. gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<summary>"
7. Merge via "Rebase and merge" on GitHub
8. Delete the branch after merge
```

## Quick-Fix Workflow

Use this for docs, cursor skills/rules, and other non-CI changes (maintainer only).

```
1. git checkout main && git pull origin main
2. Make changes and commit
3. git push origin main
```
