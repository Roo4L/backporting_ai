# Updating Project Documentation

## Documentation Structure

The project has a layered documentation structure. Understand it before making changes.

### Root files

Standard GitHub-recognized files that stay at the project root:

| File | Purpose | Update when... |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `README.md` | Project overview, "What You'll Find Here", links | Features visible to users change, new top-level sections added |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to contribute content (digests, articles, resources) | Contribution workflows or content guidelines change |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md` | Slim redirect to `docs/dev/INDEX.md` | Almost never -- only if docs/dev/ moves |

### User-facing documentation (`docs/`)

Project-specific docs aimed at non-developer users and contributors. Currently none exist; the convention is documented here for future use.

| Convention | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Location | `docs/` (not root, not `docs/dev/`) |
| Naming | UPPERCASE with underscores (e.g., `GETTING_STARTED.md`) |

### Developer documentation (`docs/dev/`)

| File | Purpose | Update when... |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `INDEX.md` | Central index linking to all dev docs | A new dev doc is added or an existing one is renamed/removed |
| `development.md` | Setup, project structure, mailing list, tech stack | Dependencies, project structure, commands, or config change |
| `git-workflow.md` | Commit conventions, branches, PRs, publishing | Git workflow conventions change |
| `design.md` | Website goals and roadmap | Project goals or roadmap change |
| `technology.md` | Technology choices, architecture, phased roadmap | Technology decisions or architecture change |
| `mailing-list-troubleshooting.md` | Common mailing list issues and solutions | New mailing list issues are discovered or resolved |

### Adding new documentation

**User-facing doc** (aimed at users/contributors):

1. Create the file in `docs/` (UPPERCASE, underscores, `.md`)
2. Add a link from `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` where relevant

**Developer doc** (aimed at developers of the site):

1. Create the file in `docs/dev/` (lowercase, hyphens, `.md`)
2. Add an entry to the table in `docs/dev/INDEX.md`
3. If it replaces content from another doc, remove the old content and add a cross-reference

## What to Update After a Feature

After implementing a feature or significant change, review this checklist:

```
- [ ] Does `README.md` still accurately describe the project and its sections?
- [ ] Does `CONTRIBUTING.md` still reflect the correct contribution process?
- [ ] Does `docs/dev/development.md` still match the project structure, commands, and config?
- [ ] If a new dev topic was introduced, does it need its own doc in `docs/dev/`?
- [ ] Are all cross-references between docs still valid (no broken links)?
- [ ] Do related skills in `.cursor/skills/` need updating?
```

Only update what actually changed -- don't rewrite docs unnecessarily.

## Cross-Reference Rules

- `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` link to `docs/dev/INDEX.md` for technical details (not directly to sub-docs)
- User-facing docs in `docs/` are linked from `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` where relevant
- Docs within `docs/dev/` link to each other by relative path (e.g., `[Git Workflow](git-workflow.md)`)
- Docs linking back to root files use `../../` (e.g., `../../README.md`)
- Skills in `.cursor/skills/` reference docs via `../../../docs/dev/` or `../../../docs/` relative paths

## Style Conventions

- Use **sentence case** for headings (capitalize first word only, plus proper nouns)
- Keep docs factual and concise -- no filler
- Use tables for structured reference, bullet lists for quick overviews
- Include code blocks with actual commands when documenting workflows
- Provide good/bad examples when documenting conventions
