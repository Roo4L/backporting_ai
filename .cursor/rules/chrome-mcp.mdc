Use Chrome Devtools MCP server for testing any changes related to UI and investigating bugs about it. If you developed some feature related to UI, or you just need to debug something in web, call Chrome Devtools MCP Server instead of requesting user
to do that for you. Verify if the site is running (by trying to open it first) and if it's not,
request the user to start it.

Do not use Cursor's in-built browser feature. Rely on the Chrome Devtools MCP server always,
because it is way more feature reature then the Cursor's extension.

Do not hesitate to make screenshots if you need. Especially, when you are fixing something visual and have to verify whether it gets rendered as expected or not.
