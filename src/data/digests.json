    "content": "## Research\n\n### [PortGPT: Towards Automated Backporting Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22396)\nPortGPT introduces an agentic LLM workflow to automate security patch backports across Linux kernel versions by orchestrating retrieval, planning, and tool‑assisted validation.\n\n### Key advancements\n- Coordinates multi‑step tool use (codebase search, file inspection, build/compile) so the model can reconcile upstream patches with legacy trees.\n- Incorporates compiler and static analysis feedback loops to iteratively refine generated edits and handle signature/API drift.\n- Emphasizes kernel‑specific challenges (large codebase, strict build health, cross‑version divergence) and reports kernel‑focused evaluation.\n\n### How it differs from prior work\n- Moves beyond rule‑based or pattern‑matching backports by using an LLM planner with feedback to adapt patches contextually.\n- Combines retrieval + validation in‑the‑loop rather than one‑shot generation or purely syntactic transforms.\n\n### [Match & Mend: Minimally Invasive Local Reassembly for Patching N-day Vulnerabilities in ARM Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14384)\nThis work proposes local reassembly to synthesize micro‑patches directly in ARM binaries, minimizing code disturbance—critical for IoT/firmware where source code or full rebuilds are impractical.\n\n### Key advancements\n- Produces compact binary‑level edits that preserve surrounding control/data flow to reduce regression risk.\n- Targets practical n‑day vulnerability remediation scenarios with deployment constraints (limited update windows, device heterogeneity).\n- Focuses on ARM, aligning with common embedded/IoT targets.\n\n### How it differs from prior work\n- Contrasts with source‑level APR and heavyweight binary rewriting by favoring localized reassembly over broad IR transformations.\n- Prior techniques often require extensive recompilation or large binary surgery; this aims for minimally invasive, targeted fixes.\n\n### [ApkDiffer: Accurate and Scalable Cross-Version Diffing Analysis for Android Applications](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/paper/apkdiffer-oopsla25.pdf)\nApkDiffer presents a method‑level diff and graph‑matching pipeline tailored for Android APKs to analyze evolution across releases at scale.\n\n### Key advancements\n- Method‑level alignment with structure‑aware matching yields more semantically meaningful diffs than text‑based approaches.\n- Designed for large‑scale cross‑version analysis supporting privacy checks, regression hunting, and update impact assessment.\n- Emphasizes scalability for real‑world app release cadences.\n\n### How it differs from prior work\n- Moves beyond line‑based diffs or generic AST matching by leveraging Android/app‑centric granularity and graph relations.\n- Prior tools often miss semantic changes or struggle with obfuscation; this targets robust alignment at the method/graph level.",
